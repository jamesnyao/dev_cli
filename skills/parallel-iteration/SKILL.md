# Parallel Iteration for Long-Running Validation

Use this strategy when validating a code change requires an expensive feedback loop — builds,
pipelines, or tests that take **1 hour or more**. Instead of trying one approach, waiting,
failing, and retrying serially, launch **three parallel agents** that each pursue a distinct
approach and converge on the validated solution.

## When to Use

- Pipeline or build validation takes 1hr+
- Multiple viable approaches exist and it's unclear which will work
- Cost of a failed attempt is high (wasted time, not resources)
- You want to maximize the chance of a first-pass success

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Analyze and Decompose

Before launching agents, understand the problem space:

- What exactly needs to change?
- What are the validation criteria? (build passes, tests green, pipeline succeeds)
- What are the plausible approaches?

### 2. Create the Knowledge File (REQUIRED)

**You MUST create a knowledge file before launching agents.** This file lives in the session
workspace and serves as both a shared context document and a living plan.

Save to: `~/.copilot/session-state/<session-id>/files/parallel-plan.md`

The file must follow this exact structure:

```markdown
# Parallel Iteration Plan

## Problem
< 2-3 sentences. What broke or needs to change. >

## Goal
< 1 sentence. The single measurable outcome. >

## Validation
< How to confirm success. Pipeline name, test command, build target. >

## Approaches

### A: <Name>
- **Idea:** < 1 sentence >
- **Key files:** < list >
- **Risk:** < 1 sentence >
- **Status:** 🔲 not started

### B: <Name>
- **Idea:** < 1 sentence >
- **Key files:** < list >
- **Risk:** < 1 sentence >
- **Status:** 🔲 not started

### C: <Name>
- **Idea:** < 1 sentence >
- **Key files:** < list >
- **Risk:** < 1 sentence >
- **Status:** 🔲 not started

## Decisions Log
| # | Decision | Why |
|---|----------|-----|

## Result
< Filled in after convergence. Which approach won and why. >
```

**Rules for the knowledge file:**

- Keep it **scannable** — bullet points, tables, short sentences
- No paragraphs longer than 2 lines
- Update status emoji as work progresses: 🔲 → 🔄 → ✅ / ❌
- Every agent reads this file at start and can reference it if lost

### 3. Launch Three Agents

Use `mode: "background"` so all three run simultaneously. Each agent prompt must include:

1. **The full knowledge file content** (copy-paste it into the prompt)
2. **Which approach (A/B/C) this agent owns**
3. **Explicit instruction not to use the other approaches**
4. **The validation step to run after making changes**

Template for agent prompts:

```text
You are Agent [A/B/C] in a parallel iteration. Three agents are working
on the same problem simultaneously, each with a different approach.

YOUR APPROACH: [Name] — [1-sentence description]
DO NOT USE these approaches (other agents own them):
- [Other approach 1]
- [Other approach 2]

PROBLEM: [from knowledge file]
GOAL: [from knowledge file]

STEPS:
1. Make the code changes for your approach
2. Run: [validation command]
3. Report: what you changed, whether validation passed, any issues

KEY FILES: [list from knowledge file]

[Paste full knowledge file here for reference]
```

**Agent configuration:**

- Use `agent_type: "general-purpose"` for complex code changes
- Use `agent_type: "task"` if the change is mechanical and validation is the bottleneck
- All three agents MUST have equal detail and effort in their prompts

### 4. Monitor and Converge

While agents run:

- You'll be notified as each completes
- Read results with `read_agent`
- Update the knowledge file status for each approach

After all complete (or first success):

- If one agent's approach passed validation → adopt it, update knowledge file `## Result`
- If multiple passed → pick the cleanest diff, note in `## Decisions Log`
- If none passed → analyze failures, create a new knowledge file for round 2

### 5. Update Knowledge File with Result

```markdown
## Result
**Winner: Approach B** — [Name]
- Passed validation: [pipeline link / test output]
- Changes: [list of files modified]
- Why others failed:
  - A: [reason]
  - C: [reason]
```

## Example: Flaky Integration Build

```markdown
# Parallel Iteration Plan

## Problem
The release pipeline fails at the packaging step after a dependency upgrade.
Each pipeline run takes about 90 minutes.

## Goal
The release pipeline completes with all packaging steps green.

## Validation
Queue the release pipeline on the fix branch and confirm the packaging stage passes.

## Approaches

### A: Pin the previous dependency version
- **Idea:** Revert the transitive dependency that changed the archive layout
- **Key files:** lock file, packaging manifest
- **Risk:** Delays the security fix the upgrade brought in
- **Status:** 🔄 in progress

### B: Update the packaging script
- **Idea:** Teach the packager about the new archive layout
- **Key files:** packaging script, its tests
- **Risk:** Other consumers may still expect the old layout
- **Status:** 🔄 in progress

### C: Normalize the layout at build time
- **Idea:** Add a build step that restores the expected directory structure
- **Key files:** build configuration
- **Risk:** Adds a step that must be maintained
- **Status:** 🔄 in progress
```

## Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do |
| --- | --- |
| Launch agents without a knowledge file | Always create the plan first |
| Give one agent more detail than others | Equal effort in all three prompts |
| Let agents pick overlapping approaches | Explicitly assign and exclude |
| Skip the validation step in agent prompts | Every agent must validate its own change |
| Forget to update the knowledge file | Update status and result after completion |
| Run more than 3 agents | 3 is the sweet spot — more adds coordination overhead |
| Use this for tasks with <30min validation | Serial iteration is fine for fast feedback loops |

## Checklist

Before launching parallel iteration, confirm:

- [ ] Knowledge file created in session workspace
- [ ] Three distinct approaches identified
- [ ] Each approach has: idea, key files, risk
- [ ] Validation command/criteria documented
- [ ] Agent prompts include full knowledge file
- [ ] Each agent knows which approaches are off-limits
